No as the room suggests lets look at cronjobs, we can cat out /etc/crontab for this.

Nothing here,

Lets check home directory,

We haev another user ubuntu and a folder named scripts

In ubuntu folder we have the flag2.txt file.

In scripts dir we have the clean_up.sh script, modifying it we can validate it is running every minutes.

Lets use this to change file permission of flag2.txt : chmod 777 /home/ubuntu/flag2.txt

Wait for cron job to finish :

We can cat out the flag : THM{b27d33705f97ba2e1f444ec2da5f5f61}
