Open Ports : 
	21 : ProFTPD 1.3.5a,
	22 : SSH OpenSSH 7.2p2,
	80 : Web

Lets check that out:
	Anonymous login not allowed on ftp.
	No user now for SSH

Lets enumerate web:
	We get challenge homepage when visited to port 80 with a message for us to help sebastian's team for the challenges ahead.
	We find a new room -> /sadistRoom
	Also we found a map.html which gives 404.
	For now lets move to /sadistRoom
	We found a message saying sebastian found a key to the locker room.
	Lets get the key : Key to locker Room => 532219a04ab7a02b56faafbec1a4c1ea
	As soon we get the key we get a message saying escape to locker room before its too late, we have to be fast and click the escape button
	We also found an image key.png in the page source, lets get that for now because it has key in name so it is suspicious
	Once we click escape room, it asks for the key. Lets use the kay we found to escape.
	We are now in Locker room, it has a message to decode a string to get a key for accessing the map.
	Encoded string : Tizmg_nv_zxxvhh_gl_gsv_nzk_kovzhv
			We can also use the link to do so : https://www.guballa.de/vigenere-solver
	Encoding Cipher : Atbash Cipher (found by applying different ciphers from CyberChef)
	Decoded String : Grant_me_access_to_the_map_please
	Lets use this to get to the map.
	We got an input field asking for the key : enter the key and press enter.
	We found 4 rooms, which have 2 new rooms for us.
		1. Sadist Room
		2. Locker Room
		3. Safe Heaven
		4. The Abandoned Room
	Lets visit the 3rd room : Safe Heaven.
	We foud a message that we are in Sebastians safe house, we are out of trouble.
	We also found some images, one image in the galary has a key symbol on it. Lets get that as well.
	We also get a message to search through the room lets use gobuster. We use directoy-list-2.3-medium.txt.
	We found a hidded directory : /keeper
	Lets visit this.
	We get a button saying escape from keeper, also we find a wili kink for the same.
	Lets use that button.
	We get an image, download it as image.jpg.
	Use the google images reverse search with the image : St. Augustine Lighthouse
	We enter that in the input box and press enter.
	We are given with keepers key : 48ee41458eb0b43bf82b986cecf3af01
	Nothing more to move foreward here.
	Lets go to another room from the maps.
	While entering the Abandoned room it asks for keeper's key, lets enter the key we just found.
	We got into The Abandoned room. It has a button go further. Nothing more in the source.
	Lets go further ...
	Again it is a time based challenge!
	While seeing the source we get a message as there is something called shell on current page, that will help.
	It looks like it is a gwt query parameter, lets enumerate it.
	Using ?shell=ls we got the listing of the pages in that dir. we found a directory : assets
	Lets check it out
	Nothing here, lets check other directories.
	looks like we can only go one directory back.
	We found three entries :
		680e89809965ec41e64dc7e447f175ab, be8bc662d1e36575a52da40beba38275, index.php
	The first entry looks like a directory as the url we are in
		http://10.10.149.239/abandonedRoom/be8bc662d1e36575a52da40beba38275/herecomeslara.php?shell=ls%20..
	Lets try to visit from browser
		We get can move to that directory :
		We found two entries:
			helpme.zip
			you_made_it.txt
	Lets get those files.
	The text file just contains a message, nothing important.
	We get two files once we unzip the helpme.zip file.
		1. helpme.txt
		2. Table.jpg	
	Lets check the text file:
		There is a message from Joseph, saying Ruvik locked him in cell and key is on the Table.
	Lets check Table.jpg:
		We cannot open the file because it contains some errors, lets enumerate.
		We cna see key.wav in strings of this file.
		Lets check file type.
		We see that it is a zip archive desguised as jpg
		Lets extract it.
		We got two more files:
			1. Joseph_Oda.jpg
			2. key.wav	
	Lets check the files.
		The wav file looks like it is some sound code.
		It is a morse code indeed.
		Lets crack it : SHOWME

	Lets use this as a passphrse for Josephs image.
	We found his credentials for ftp.

	Lets use this to login to FTP
	We found two more files:
		program and random.dic
	Lets check the progarm:
		It needs and input text parameter, lets loop through the random dict.
		It dosent work, the prgram is unable to get values from file
		Lets move the values to txt file.
			strings random.dic > inputs.txt
		Lets loop through it:
			while read LINE; do ./program "$LINE"; done < inputs.txt
		
		We found a valid usename and encoded message :
		kidman => Correct
		Well Done !!!
		Decode This => 55 444 3 6 2 66 7777 7 2 7777 7777 9 666 777 3 444 7777 7777 666 7777 8 777 2 66 4 33
		
		This looks like multitap phone cipher lets decode it.
		55 444 3 6 2 66 7777 7 2 7777 7777 9 666 777 3 444 7777 7777 666 7777 8 777 2 66 4 33
		K   I  D M A N   S   P A  S    S   W  O   R  D  I   S    S    O   S   T  R  A  N G E
		We got the password : KIDMANSPASSWORDISSOSTRANGE

	Lets SSH:
		We foud users flag : 4C72A4EF8E6FED69C72B4D58431C4254

	PrivEsc:
		Sudo : Nothing is available.
		Cron Jobs : */2 * * * * root python3 /var/.the_eye_of_ruvik.py
		This runs everu two minutes.
		Lets check this out:
		It echo a file into kidmans home directory with some text.
		Lets use it to cat /root/root.txt
			subprocess.call("cat /root/root.txt > /home/kidman/.the_eye.txt",shell=True)
		Wait for two minutes jor cron job to run and then cat out .the_eye.txt
		We got roots flag : BA33BDF5B8A3BFC431322F7D13F3361E !!!

	For Bonus :
		Delete ruviks account :
		subprocess.call("userdel ruvik",shell=True)
		Wait for two minutes for the job to run,
		Verify using /etc/passwd file, the account will be deleted.

	Completed !!!
