We got an error in getting the image as it contains some errors, lets check that out.

We didnt get a jpg header, there is something wrong with the file.

we found that the file has a header of png with extention .jpg

Lets see how we can edit that.
replace the first bit with the first bit on an jpg file using hexedit.

The file is now openable, We found a hidden directory : /th1s_1s_h1dd3n

Visiting that we got a message to guess a secret, in source we found that it is between 0-99 lets check that out.
Lets check that in burp.
	Assuming it has emphasis on secret lets use that as a query paramter.. It works,
	So we have a query parameter, lets take this to intruder in burp.

	We found the secret number as 73 : we got something looks like a password : y2RPJ4QaPF!B 

It might have to do something with stego:
Lets check that with thm.jpg we downloaded earlier : 
	We got a username : wbxre
	It looks like it is ciphered:
	Lets check it , indeed its a rot 13 cipher, from the hint : actual username : joker

Since we dont have the password, we still cant SSH
	We have another image at the challenge home page, on THM lets check that out.
	Yes! this was indeed a stego image we extracted password.txt from it.
	We found the password : *axA&GF8dP

Lets try SSH:
	We are in, lets enumerate and get the flags.
	We found the user flag!!

	We can not use sudo..

	Lets use linpeas.sh for further enumeration:
		We found a potential SUID PE vector named : /bin/screen-4.5.0
		Lets google it out.
			We found an exploit : https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41154
			Lets move to /tmp diectory and use it.(use nano to craete exploit.sh and copy the contents)
			Make the file executable and execute.
			We dropped int a root shell, lets get the root flag!!!
