Most of the time, you won’t be looking for something in your working directory. The first argument of your find 
command should be the directory you want to search. The command will search in that directory and in all its 
subdirectories. So, if you want to search the whole filesystem, your command should begin with find /.


Two very useful flags are the -type and -name flags. With -type, you can use d to only find directories, and f to 
only find files. The -name flag is used to specify a name or pattern to look for. You can type the whole name, or 
use wildcards to specify only part(s) of the name. If you use wildcards, you need to enclose your pattern in 
quotes, otherwise the command won't work as intended. It is useful to know that you can also use the -iname flag; 
same as -name, but case insensitive.



Find all files whose name ends with ".xml"
	find / -type f -name "*.xml"


Find all files in the /home directory (recursive) whose name is "user.txt" (case insensitive)
	find /home -type f -name user.txt


Find all directories whose name contains the word "exploits"
	find / -type d -name "*exploits*"


In some situations, specifying just the name of a file will not be enough. You can also specify the owner, the 
size, the permissions, and the time the file was last accessed/modified as well.


The username of the owner of a file is specified with the -user flag.


The size of a file is specified with the -size flag. When using numerical values, the formats -n, +n, and n can 
be used, where n is a number. -n matches values lesser than n, +n matches values greater than n, and 
n matches values exactly n. To specify a size, you also need a suffix. c is the suffix for bytes, k for KiB’s, 
and M for MiB’s. So, if you want to specify a size less than 30 bytes, the argument -30c should be used.


The -perm flag is used to specify permissions, either in octal form (ex. 644) or in symbolic form (ex. u=r). 
See here for a short reference. If you specify the permission mode as shown above (ex. 644 or u=r), then 
find will only return files with those permissions exactly. You can use the – or / prefix to make your search 
more inclusive. Using the – prefix will return files with at least the permissions you specify; this means that 
the -444 mode will match files that are readable by everyone, even if someone also has write and/or execute 
permissions. 
Using the / prefix will return files that match any of the permissions you have set; this means that the /666 
mode will match files that are readable and writeable by at least one of the groups (owner, group, or others).


Lastly, time-related searches will be covered. These are more complex but may prove useful. The flag consists of 
a word and a prefix. The words are min and time, for minutes and days, respectively. The prefixes are a, m, and 
c, and are used to specify when a file was last accessed, modified, or had its status changed. As for the 
numerical values, the same rules of the -size flag apply, except there is no suffix. To put it all together: in 
order to specify that a file was last accessed more than 30 minutes ago, the option -amin +30 is used. To specify 
that it was modified less than 7 days ago, the option -mtime -7 is used. (Note: when you want to specify that a 
file was modified within the last 24 hours, the option -mtime 0 is used.)


Find all files owned by the user "kittycat"
	find / -type f -user kittycat

Find all files that are exactly 150 bytes in size
	find / -type f -size 150c

Find all files in the /home directory (recursive) with size less than 2 KiB’s and extension ".txt"
	find /home -type f -size -2k -name "*.txt"

Find all files that are exactly readable and writeable by the owner, and readable by everyone else (use octal format)
	find / -type f -perm 644

Find all files that are only readable by anyone (use octal format)
	find / -type f -perm 444

Find all files with write permission for the group "others", regardless of any other permissions, with extension ".sh" (use symbolic format)
	find / -type f -perm u=w -name "*.sh"

Find all files in the /usr/bin directory (recursive) that are owned by root and have at least the SUID permission (use symbolic format)
	find /usr/bin -type f -perm u=su -user root
	Octal form : SUID - 4000, SGID - 2000, both - 6000

Find all files that were not accessed in the last 10 days with extension ".png"
	find / -type f -atime -10 -name "*.png"

Find all files in the /usr/bin directory (recursive) that have been modified within the last 2 hours
	find /usr/bin -type f -mmin -120


To conclude this tutorial, there are two more things that you should know of. The first is that you can use the 
redirection operator > with the find command. You can save the results of the search to a file, and more 
importantly, you can suppress the output of any possible errors to make the output more readable. This is done 
by appending 2> /dev/null to your command. This way, you won’t see any results you’re not allowed to access.


The second thing is the -exec flag. You can use it in your find command to execute a new command, following 
the -exec flag, like so: -exec whoami \;. The possibilities enabled by this option are beyond the scope of this 
tutorial, but most notably it can be used for privilege escalation.

Find all SUID and SGID executables.

	find / -type f -a\( -perm -u+s -o -perm -perm -g+s \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2> /dev/null
